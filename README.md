# South Central Alaska FAA Place Name Drill

This app will allow you to test yourself on the names of place names in the south central area of 
Alaska.  It presents blank areas on maps of south central Alaska for which the names need to be memorized
and will reveal their names if you hover your mouse over them to help you drill yourself about them.

## Technical Aspects

It is developed as a javascript [React](https://reactjs.org) web app.  The data for this 
app is contained in the src/data.json file.
That file may be edited to modify the data that is displayed in the app. React allows you 
to build a website as a hierarchy of independent components. The source code includes 
a facility (called [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)) for developing those React 
components in isolation. In addition to the commands available as described below, you can use
"npm run storybook", "pnpm storybook" or "yarn storybook" (depending on your favorite 
build tool) to start storybook on 
[http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).  

This webapp was originally developed using [PNPM](hhtps://pnpm.io) as it's build tool
to take advantage of it's diskspace and build speed efficiencies.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
